/*
for math beyond the basics, java has the math class with methods
that we can do other operations

A method is a named block of code that java "jumps" to that code
to execute that block

The math file is in the special package, java.lang which contains the files that are
considered so fundamental to most Java programs

Math.sqrt(); 
Math.abs(); 
Note that java assume angles in Radian (Rad) and inverse cos/sin return to rads
Note: we do NOT use ^ in Java. Instead, we use the pow method

NaN: Not a Number 
e.g. sqrt(-1)

Note Math.pow(a,b) always return a decimal number 
we can cast to integer by placing (int) before the Math.pow(a,b)
(int) Math.pow(2, 5) = 32 (Not 32.0)
