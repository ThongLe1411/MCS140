ERRORS/ Bugs
we will learn to be patient as we fix these bugs (debugging)
1. Compiler errors: if you have a compiler error, your program not even get to run/execute
2. Runtime error - you're now able to compile the code. While the program is running, often
causing the program to "crash," stop unexpectedly 
3. Logic errors - the program runs, but the solution/output is incorrect. The program's logic is unsound 
(e.g. wrong formula being used, wrong algorithm being applied)

COMMENTs: 
1. line comment - everything typed on a line after // will be treated as a comment by Java
2. multiple-line commnent - Everything in the comment basket

HOMEWORK: 
1. Upload the code/ succeed to find the file O.O 
2. Code check bla bla...
