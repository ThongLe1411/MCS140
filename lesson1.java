/**
 * LESSON 1: INTRO TO THE JAVA LANGUAGE
 * course objective:
 * - have the idea of a computer
 * - A program is a series of instruction that tell the computer
 * what to do
 * 
 * we will learn Java programming language, multiple purpose, high level, which feels like nature language (Eng + math)
 * 
 * - cross-platfrom language 
 * 
 * We write "sourced code", this is stored in a .java file 
 * 
 * This code is then "compiled" by a separate program (a Java compiler)
 * - 1. check for error, ensures the code is proper, "valid" Java code.
 * - 2. translate to a lower-level, virtual machine language (similar to an actual machine language, 
 * but run on a special Java program). The Virtual code is stored in a .class file (byte code).
 * 
 * That file then is run on the virtual machine, which interprets it into the actual machine language
 * 
 * -3. Optimizes the code. It strips away unnecessary portions that are just for us humans can also rearrange
 * or replace to make the code more efficient. 
 * 
 * Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
